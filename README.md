## Time Series Copula Models

This package contains functions for the analysis of time series using copula models. A full description of a strictly stationary time series can be obtained by choosing a univariate marginal distribution and a time series copula process, i.e. a serially dependent process of uniform random variables. Examples of the latter are the copula processes of Gaussian ARMA models and D-vine copula processes. Methods are provided for simulation and estimation of time series copula models.
